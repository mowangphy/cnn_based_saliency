# cnn_based_saliency
This project uses CNN back-propagation to do image saliency detection, and achieved state-of-the-art performance with fast speed.

On Pascal VOC 2012 this method achieves 0.685 F_0.3 score on the test set.

Based on MatConvNet

MatConvNet is a MATLAB toolbox implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple, efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit the homepage to know more.
